# Safety watcher
## Context :
The goal of this project is to provide a scalable solution for a city to monitor and deal with suspicious behavior in daily life situations to maintain public safety. This system needs to be efficient and able to process a large amount of data.
For that weâ€™ll:
-	 Collect real-time data from city CCTV and sensors
-	Analyze the data to identify suspicious activities or behaviors.
-	Trigger alerts for law enforcement agencies to intervene when necessary.
-	Store the data to perform analytics and identify patterns/trends in criminal activities or public disturbances. Analysts will use those insights to allocate resources effectively and develop proactive strategies to prevent crime.
